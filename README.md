## Project Summary

This project is built using GDScript, the scripting language for the Godot Engine. It includes the following key components:

- **Game Mechanics**: Core gameplay logic is implemented, handling player interactions, physics, and game rules.
- **UI System**: Scripts manage user interface elements such as menus, buttons, and HUDs.
- **Scene Management**: Efficient scene transitions and loading mechanisms are in place.
- **AI Behavior**: Basic AI scripts control non-player characters and their interactions.
- **Utilities**: Helper scripts provide reusable functionality for tasks like data management and debugging.

The codebase is structured to ensure modularity and maintainability, leveraging Godot's node-based architecture.
